# 3D-Sliding-Puzzle

## What is it?
An elementary bad written script for a 3D sliding puzzle.  
Name is not update; dimension are customizable but the graphic results can be awful.  
Anyways, my first puzzle with Pygame.  

For try it, download it and open using Python.

## Commands
For moving tiles on same level, use "J" as left, "L" as right, "I" as up and "K" as down.  
For moving between layers, use "W" as up and "S" as down.  
Scramble with Spacebar.

## Example
